Just left the theater, my brain's still rattling like an old engine and that ache in my back like a nagging reminder of how long those seats are not. God, how popcorn manages to sneak into every crevice, like it’s on a mission. Marked Men, though — wow, what a whirlwind. Bits of brilliance sparkle through my head like shattered glass. 

There was this one scene, felt like being tackled by a bulldozer full-speed; the lead, I think his name was Ryan or Jake or something, he’s staring at his reflection, but it's like he’s looking through it into some abyss. Could feel the weight, like carrying a television in the rain, slippery grip on reality. The noise in the theater wasn’t helping either, whispers like persistent mosquitoes. Or maybe I imagined it — happens when you’re lost between popcorn crunches and screen flash.

> There was this one shot in the   — it played out like a deja vu I couldn't place. You ever get that? Like you’ve lived it before, though this was new? They kept calling back to this scene with a red door, which shouldn’t mean anything, but now I want a tattoo of one. Or maybe not. 

And the villain, oh boy, like a cat that learned to walk on its hind legs and revels in the newfound power. Every scene he stepped into felt like someone turned the temperature gauge to meandering swelter. The kind of cold sweat moments that make you verbalize, Should I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? 

At some point, I caught myself thinking about how it connected pieces like fragmented poetry. Nah, more like a scrambled egg — flavors mixed yet distinct, held together by the gooey threads of plot. Not perfect, but delicious in its chaos. Theater was packed too; someone asked earlier if they could 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   but ain't nothing like the live experience. Sometimes felt like the guy next to me was shooting his commentary for a youtube channel. That or he’s conducting some cosmic interview only he knows about.

Do I even want to explain the scene with the pigeons? I wonder, pigeons in a city setting as if they’re marking their own territory with fluttery authority, strange nods at 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦dom that somehow nested in a box.
